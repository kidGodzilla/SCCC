I am an instructor at Seattle Central Community College and am also a free-lance designer, audio engineer and musician.</p><p>Recently my girlfriend Karin and I purchased a two bedroom house in Burien, just south of Seattle proper. We live there with our dog Summer and our two cats Sissy &amp; Chico. We have a nice yard and I am building my music studio in the basement.</p><p>My life, my art, and the passions I truly believe in matter to me the most in my life rather than selling out to the media and marketing schemes of our world and believing in "what they tell me." Somehow I seem to create every day whether it be a written piece a sketch in my notebook or a song that journals my life.</p><!-- End About Text --></body></html><!-- Created by Mike Sinkula -->
