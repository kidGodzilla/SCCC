Barbacoa has quickly made itself at home on Queen Anne Avenue. &quot;We are part of a community here and we would much rather see a guest three times a month rather than once a month. That's why we try to provide them with great food and a decent price,&quot; says Colegrove.</p>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the narrow restaurant that seats 30, signature Tex-Mex dishes are served up in a warm environment featuring ivory painted walls and a high ceiling stained in rustic brown. Southwest accents, charm and a Roy Rogers portrait grace the wall opposite the compact bar. The bar, hand built by Colegrove and Calderon, is made entirely from 140 feet of chair rails and includes well-worn barstools and restaurant chairs which were recovered from a church and hand-painted by Colegrove and Calderon as well.</p>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbacoa was envisioned long before the space was bought. Before construction began Calderon envisioned a roadhouse-type eatery and Colegrove dreamed of something more upscale, but the two were able to compromise. </p>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two owners had already known each other for five years during Calderon's time as Chef and General Manager for Cactus in Madison Park. Colegrove was a faithful customer making his way through culinary school. As fate would have it, Colegrove applied for an internship at Cactus in order to finish his school requirements. When they discovered they shared a desire to have their own place and be their own bosses, they partnered up.</p>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The rewards from this labor of love come directly out of the kitchen: &quot;Big Vittles&quot; to &quot;Little Vittles,&quot; inspired by the Lone Star state. Calderon and Colegrove strive to surprise people with their fiery, festive and fun food. At times a tad over-inspired, they confess it's often hard to keep dishes off the menu.</p>		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back, both men agree, &quot;We couldn't have done it without really great friends and family. They really believed in us. We hadn't done anything like this before, but it all came together like it was supposed to be.&quot;</p>		</div>	<!-- End Left -->		<!-- Begin Right -->	<div id="right">		<p>Right Column</p>	</div>	<!-- End Right -->		<!-- Begin Clear -->	<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>	<!-- End Clear -->	</div><!-- End Middle --><!-- Begin Footer --><div id="footer">	<img src="images/footer.gif" /></div><!-- End Footer --></body></html>
