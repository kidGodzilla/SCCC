Because the web is a dynamic          medium, page designers also wanted their pages to interact with the          user, so Netscape invented JavaScript as a way to control interactivity        on web pages.</p>        <p>2. Because A JavaScript script it is enclosed in a script        tag, the text of the script does not appear on the user&#8217;s screen.</p>        <p>3.          The &lt;script&gt; tag is most often found in the head tag, though        you can put scripts in the body tag (i.e., script that write text on        the screen).<br />        4. Buttons that highlight as you mouse over them are called rollover        buttons.<br />        5. It is a good idea to get into the habit of adding comments to your        scripts, which will help to explain why you solved the problem in a particular        way.<br />        6. JavaScript is an object-oriented language.<br />        7. Objects can have properties; a window can have a title, and a form        can have a checkbox.<br />        8. A function is a piece of JavaScript code that is defined once in a        program and can be executed, or invoked, many times by the program and        can also be passed arguments or parameters.<br />        9. A value is any piece of information In JavaScript; the kinds you may        be most familiar with are numerical.<br />        10. A string value is a sequence of sequence of zero or more letters,        digits, punctuation, or characters enclosed within single or double quotation        marks.<br />        11. It is common to use an event handler like &#8220;onClick&#8221; to        call a function from a user&#8217;s action.<br />        12. When you assign a value to a variable, you use an assignment operator        to do the job; which are simple arithmetic symbols.<br />        13. Boolean values are generally the result of comparison statements        you make in your JavaScript code and have only two possible values, true        or false.<br />        14. These comparison statements in your JavaScript code that result in &#8220;Boolean&#8221; values        are called conditionals.<br />        15. Conditionals break down into three parts: if (where we do our test),        then (where we put the part of the script we want to do if the result        is true) and else (which contains the part of the script we want to have        happen if the result of the test is not true).<br />        16. To open a new browser window you need to use the window.open method        (or return value) within your function to open the window when the function        is called from an event handler.<br />        17. When creating a slideshow, you must start out by declaring a variable        to which you will define a new object with an array of images that will        perform in the slideshow.<br />        18. When validating an email address, we need to use a &#8220;for&#8221; statement        with an initialization loop which scans through the string of invalid        characters we have defined<br />        19. When writing the current date and/or time to our document window        we need to use the document.write method within the body tag, to write        our current date and/or time to the users&#8217; document window.<br />        20. Now that we find ourselves needing to use Cascading Style Sheet more        often and referring to objects as elements with ID names, we will also        need to use the newer W3C standard document.getElementById Document Object        Model within our JavaScript functions that the newer browsers comply        to.<br />      21. This final exam was way too easy. </p></td>      <td><img src="images/colorbar.gif" width="46" height="135" /></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><img src="images/regmark.gif" width="46" height="46" /></td>      <td><img src="images/regmark.gif" width="46" height="46" /></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><img src="images/spacer.gif" width="46" height="135" /></td>      <td><img src="images/spacer.gif" width="46" height="135" /></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><img src="images/cropmark_bl.gif" width="46" height="46" /></td>      <td><img src="images/spacer.gif" width="278" height="46" /></td>      <td><img src="images/regmark.gif" width="46" height="46" /></td>      <td><img src="images/spacer.gif" width="278" height="46" /></td>      <td><img src="images/cropmark_br.gif" width="46" height="46" /></td>    </tr></table>  <table width="725" border="0" cellspacing="25" cellpadding="0" align="center">    <tr>       <td class="copyright">        <p>&copy; 1996 - 2005 Premium Design Works.
